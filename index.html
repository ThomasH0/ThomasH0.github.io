        <h1>History</h1>
        <p class="historyText">
        Blue Team (Italian: “Squadra Azzurra”) represented Italy in international contract bridge tournaments winning sixteen 
        world titles between 1957 to 1969
        Three regular pairs: Walter Avarelli, Giorgio Belladonna, Pietro Forquet, Benito Garozzo, and Massimo D’Alelio. 
        The spiritual father, long-time coach, and non-playing captain to 1966 was Carl’Alberto Perroux
        </p><p class="historyText">
        The United States was considered the best in the world after the war. Captain Perroux would undergo long-term 
        preparations to win.
        </p><p class="historyText">
        In 1956 Blue Team won their first bowl defeating the champion France in Stockholm allowing them to contest the 
        1957 Bermuda Bowl in New York City where they defeated a United States team. The players were Walter Avarelli, 
        Giorgio Belladonna, Eugenio Chiaradia, Massimo d’Alelio, Pietro Forquet, and Gulielmo Siniscalco. 
        They continued to reign, winning twelve world team championships in their thirteen years from 1957 to 1969. 
        Blue Team retired after 1969 but key members would return to win four more world titles between 1972 and 1975. 
        </p><p class="historyText">
        Most of their success was due to the bidding systems, teams would complain that the Italians had an unfair 
        advantage due to them using bids that were partly incomprehensible to Americans.
